A collection of command line games written in python using curses.

### Current games:

- vim-snake
Snake with a twist. Instead of using Up, down, left, and right keys,
the keys to control the snake are simlar to vim.
This could potentially help a begginer get comfortable
with basic movements in vim.

*Controls:*
```
h - Left
j - Down
k - Up
l - Right
```
